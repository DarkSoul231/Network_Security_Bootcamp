# Hasing And Salting Using Python Encryption Techniques.


> It this problem solutions we add extra layer of Encryption to the user input using ```Python``` Built in Library ```hashlib```. 
In it we use various hashing algorithm of ```haslib``` library to protect data.
We also use ```SALTING``` and ```ITERATION``` Techniques to enhance the Encryption of Data.

> In Problem 1 : [ [Check Out Solution](https://github.com/DarkSoul231/Network_Security_Bootcamp/blob/main/Problem%201%20Hash%20md5.py) ]
   ``` 
   - We Generate Hash value of String Given By User Using MD5 hashlib Library Algorithm
   ```
> In Problem 2 : [ [Check Out Solution](https://github.com/DarkSoul231/Network_Security_Bootcamp/blob/main/Problem%202%20Multiple%20hashlib%20algorithms.py) ]
   ``` 
   - We Generate Hash value of String Given By User Using Multiple hashlib Library Algorithm
   - Such As MD5 SHA1 SHA256 and So On
   ```
> In Problem 3 : [ [Check Out Solution](https://github.com/DarkSoul231/Network_Security_Bootcamp/blob/main/Problem%203%20Iteration%20and%20Salting%20of%20String.py) ]
   ``` 
   - We Generate Multiple Iterated Hash Value of String Given By User Using NoOfIteration Value.
   - Also we Salt That Iterated Hashed Value To Add Extra Layer of Encryption To User String.
